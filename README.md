# Jupyter Notebooks For Reproducible Research

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/olexandr-konovalov/repro-jupyter/master) [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/olexandr-konovalov/libraries/repro-jupyter)

This repository is for giving a talk on using Jupyter Notebooks For Reproducible Research and discussing the paper 
[Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Research in Jupyter Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055)
by Adam Rule et al.

The talk is supposed to be given using the very technology that is the subject of the talk.
The slides are contained in `notebooks/JupyterNotebooksForReproducibleResearch.ipynb`, 
which may be launched on [Binder](https://mybinder.org) by clicking on the Binder badge above.
The Jupyter notebook will be translated into a `reveal.js`-based presentation using the Jupyter 
extension called [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io).

The `notebooks/Inflammation.ipynb` example is taken from the Software Carpentry lesson
"Programming with Python": (<http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/>).
